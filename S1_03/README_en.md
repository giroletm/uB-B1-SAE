# SAÉ 1.03 - Installing a development units

[Version française](https://github.com/giroletm/uB-B1-SAE/tree/master/S1_03/README.md)

This version was translated from french.

## Subject

You will simulate the setup of two computers that fulfill clients' needs. There will be three steps:
- Precising the machines (and the components) to buy to equip the unit. With a given budget, you have to choose the components to buy to build the two computers in a way that corresponds to the clients' needs, and simulate the building of those units with the chosen components.
- Simulate software installation on those units. You will install and configure two virtual machines simulating the computers you have to build. This includes: the operating system, creating a user account, installing an EDI.
- Write scripts that allow the user to perform repetitive pre-defined tasks (it can be shell scripts that create or delete files for example).

You will write a report that describes:
- The choices made for the hardware (type of machine, CPU, memory, devices...) that might have established a purchase order. You have to describe those choices in great detail.
- A description of the various installation and configuration steps of the machine. This description must allow to easily reproduce the entirety of your work on both systems.
- The shell scripts. Those will be described in the report with an explanation for each executed command.
- How each member of the group contributed. The report must describe how tasks were split among your group.

Along with the report, you will have to present your work orally. During this 15 minutes presentation, you and your group will present the aforementioned elements and will then answer to questions.

This subject puts you in the role of an IT company that configures and builds on-demand computers, depending of the clients' needs. During this project, you will have to engage in this role and consider clients who needs explanations and justifications on every choice made. The two computers you are asked to build are:
1. A familly computer
2. An IT student's computer

For size reasons, the virtual machines are not uncluded in thos repository.
