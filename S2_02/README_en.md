# SAÉ 2.02 - Algorithm exploration of a problem

## Subject

This project's goal is to program a Pathfinding algorithm.

Picture a character evolving in a 2D environment. It moves on a map made out of different regions that can be forests, lakes, blocking rivers, villages, etc. All of those areas affect the speed at which the character moves, or can block him entirely.

You must create a 2D environment full of obstacles and areas where the character's speed is affected by those hazards.

Your goal is to be able to determine the shortest path between two points in the map.
