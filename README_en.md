## Content

These folders contain the various projects I have made with my classmates during my freshman year in *BUT Informatique*.

Some projects are missing, either because I couldn't get permission from the classmates who've worked on them with me, or because they aren't interesting to show off on GitHub.

## Licence

The source codes of the projects published here are present for purely educational purposes.

They must not be reused in projects that involve any other purpose, and you must obtain the permission from every participant of the project you want to reuse the code of in order to do so.

See [LICENCE](https://github.com/giroletm/uB-B1-SAE/tree/master/LICENCE).
